# Clabgate: production plan

This document is the implementation contract for replacing JupyterHub with one
Kubernetes namespace per CMS/LTI attempt. It describes the first production
release; later collaboration work must not weaken its isolation model.

## Accepted decisions

- The existing CMS server/client with type `k8s` remains the owner of attempts.
- Clabgate is responsible for the complete namespace: task manifests,
  Clabernetes topology, JupyterLab, checker jobs, status and deletion.
- `CMS_TASK_URL` is a full GitLab or GitHub project URL, for example
  `https://github.com/group/task-collection`. `labs_path` is a directory inside
  that project. `test_path` is optional, is never fetched or executed by
  Clabgate, and is forwarded to the trusted checker image as a compile-time
  registry selector.
- A CMS attempt stays `pending` while resources are being provisioned. It becomes
  `active` only after Clabgate observes the topology (when present) and Jupyter
  Deployment as ready. Kubernetes is the runtime source of truth.
- One attempt has one owner and one JupyterLab in this release. A future
  `collaboration` value greater than one will map several authorized CMS users
  to the same attempt; it is intentionally not implemented yet.
- Students and instructors can start the checker. A checker result contains a
  stable `check_id`, score, human-readable report and bounded logs. CMS remains
  responsible for LTI/Moodle grade synchronization.
- The production deployment keeps two Clabgate replicas. Only the elected
  leader runs background reconciliation; both replicas serve HTTP requests.

## Session state machine

```text
CMS pending
    -> namespace/provisioning
    -> namespace/ready + CMS active
    -> CMS terminating
    -> namespace deleted + CMS completed
```

The namespace has `labs.cmslabs.ru/session-phase` and
`labs.cmslabs.ru/ready-at` annotations. Namespace existence alone never means
that an attempt is active. A failed/degraded topology also never activates it.
All transitions are monotonic and retryable. Repeated reconciliation or a
restarted Clabgate must converge on the same objects.

## Task source and allowed manifests

Clabgate uses the GitLab or GitHub Repository API selected from
`CMS_TASK_URL`. It resolves `CMS_TASK_BRANCH`, recursively lists `.yaml` and
`.yml` blobs below the normalized `labs_path`, sorts file paths, downloads the
exact files and records the resolved commit SHA in the namespace.

For the first release the allow-list is deliberately small:

- `v1/ConfigMap` (zero or more);
- `clabernetes.containerlab.dev/v1alpha1/Topology` (exactly one when any task
  manifest exists).

Cluster-scoped objects, RBAC, Secrets, workloads and arbitrary metadata are
rejected. Clabgate overwrites namespace and ownership labels. This boundary is
what makes applying repository-owned YAML safe enough for production.

Private projects use optional `TASK_REPOSITORY_TOKEN` (`GITLAB_TOKEN` remains a
legacy fallback); the token is sent only to the
host from `CMS_TASK_URL` and is never copied into a laboratory namespace.

## JupyterLab access

JupyterLab listens only on its ClusterIP Service and runs without its own bearer
token. Browser access is protected by the application gateway:

1. an authenticated CMS user calls `session.open`;
2. Clabgate verifies attempt ownership (or instructor/admin role) and returns a
   short-lived, single-purpose signed grant;
3. the browser exchanges the grant for a `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`
   workspace cookie and is redirected to a clean URL;
4. nginx checks every HTTP and WebSocket request through Clabgate
   `auth_request` before proxying to the namespace Service.

This reuses the current CMS JWT/OIDC login without exposing a long-lived token
in URLs, browser history or Jupyter logs. `WORKSPACE_AUTH_SECRET` is shared by
both Clabgate replicas and must come from Vault.

Jupyter Pods and checker Pods set `automountServiceAccountToken: false`.
Jupyter gets only its PVC. Checker is a network/topology check in this release
and does not mount the RWO notebook PVC.

Laboratory checks live in the separate `github.com/maintainer64/cms-labs-checker`
repository. Each `labs/<name>` package implements the stable `LabChecker`
interface and owns its `_test.go` files. The packages are linked into one static
binary through an explicit registry; Go plugins are deliberately avoided because
their compiler/dependency ABI requirements make container releases fragile.

## Checker result contract

The checker writes one JSON object to `/dev/termination-log`:

```json
{
  "max_score": 10,
  "current_score": 8,
  "result_display": "8/10 checks passed",
  "report": "Optional Markdown summary",
  "tasks": [{
    "title": "SSH connectivity",
    "description": "Router accepts SSH connections",
    "logs": [{"node": "r1", "message": "connected"}],
    "complete": true
  }]
}
```

Clabgate adds the generated `check_id` and bounded Pod logs, then sends the
result to CMS. CMS stores these fields in `LTIAttemptResult` and performs the
existing LTI grade sync. Re-delivery with the same `check_id` is idempotent.
Checker Jobs are retained temporarily for inspection and then removed by the
Kubernetes TTL controller.

## Production gates

- Unit tests cover GitLab/GitHub path handling, manifest ordering/allow-list, readiness
  transitions, workspace grant validation, checker selection and each registered
  laboratory implementation.
- `go test ./...`, frontend typecheck/lint/build and Helm rendering pass.
- RBAC includes only namespaced session resources, Namespace lifecycle and the
  Lease used for leader election.
- Resource requests/limits and probes exist for Clabgate, Jupyter and checker.
- Logs never contain repository tokens, CMS passwords, workspace grants/cookies or
  notebook contents.
- Before cutover, finish or explicitly terminate old JupyterHub attempts owned
  by the same `k8s` client. Otherwise the new reconciler cannot distinguish an
  old Hub attempt with no namespace from a deleted Clabgate session.

## Deferred after the first release

- collaboration greater than one;
- idle timeout and storage retention policy;
- per-course images/resources and GPU scheduling;
- richer checker artifact storage beyond bounded CMS report/log fields;
- informer caches and horizontal scale beyond the current two replicas.
